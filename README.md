## VRChat OSC Chatbox Python

This is NOT an alternative to tools like MagicChatbox, This does not have any customization besides status messages, this is simply a tool for me to use since I don't like the bloatware which MagicChatbox contains.


All Status messages go in ```bin\status.txt```, seperate by Skip Line.

All Emojis go in ```bin\emojis.txt```, Seperate by ```,```

Create a ```.env``` file, Create 2 Enviorment variables called ```CLIENT_ID``` and ```CLIENT_SECRET```, Fill these in with information at [Spotify Developer Dashboard](https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/)

Run ```Run.bat``` to start Script.
