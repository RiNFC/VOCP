Ri is my Favorite Son, he made me my chatbox <3
to be a star you must burn
the world is cruel; therefore I won't be
stars can't shine without darkness
do it because they said you couldn't
fight it or accept it
fear it or control it
pretend to be brave, even if you're not, they won't notice
like the moon, we must go through phases of feeling empty to be full again
close the window that hurts you, no matter how pretty the view is
